# VVHSS Thamarakulam - Complaint Registration Portal

This project is a simple web portal for **VVHSS Thamarakulam** that provides two user options: **Admin** and **Student**. The portal allows students to access their designated page, while the admin requires a password to proceed.

## Features

- **Simple and Minimalistic UI**: Clean and futuristic design for a school portal.
- **Two User Options**:
  - **Student**: Redirects to the student page.
  - **Admin**: Opens a password-protected modal for admin login.
- **Password Protection**: Admin access is protected by a password (`vvcomplaintportal`).
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to various screen sizes.

## Structure

- **Main Heading**: Displays the name of the school, "VVHSS Thamarakulam".
- **Subheading**: "Complaint Registration Portal" to clarify the purpose of the site.
- **Student Option**: Clicking on the "Student" button will redirect the user to the student page (`studentPage.html`).
- **Admin Option**: Clicking on the "Admin" button opens a modal to enter the password. If the correct password (`vvcomplaintportal`) is entered, the user is redirected to the admin page (`adminPage.html`).
